  App.svelte is the root component of the game. 
  
  In Svelte, a component  consists the script,  layout and styling of a specific functional part of a website.
  It is defined in a .svelte file just like this one.

  Xstate is another really helpful library. It allows me to define thwe overall flow of the game.
  Which makes everything is trackable. I am not a state machine expert, but I know that
  state machine is something that game developer always use to track the game state in a game.

  Xstate brings state machine onto the web, and it works great with Svelte.

  /*
  The gameState.js file contains the state machine defined for the game, this can be consider as
  the core of the whole game experience which defines nearly all the states of the game.

  Here I import the state machine from the gameState.js file.
  */
  import gameState from "./lib/Game/logic/gameState";

  /*
  Here, the Game component is imported from the Game.svelte file. 
  The Game component includes the statsboard, battleground as well
  as the gesture detection modal of the game.
  */

  /*
  The StartMenu component 
  */
  import StartMenu from "./lib/StartMenu/StartMenu.svelte";
  // This variable defines weather the game has been started

  // TODO: Expalin what does it works
  const gameService = interpret(gameState, { devTools: true }).start();
</script>

<main>
  <!-- Add a dollar sign($) at the begining of a variable tells the Svelte to
   re-run the code containing this variable when the value changes.

   In this exmaple, if the currently state of the game is not startMenu,
   the html will be rerendered, the StartMenu component will be onmounted
   and at the same time the Game component will be mounted.

   {#if} ... {/if} is a Svelte specific syntax. It bring the if else syntax from javascript to the DOM. 

   As stated in the Svelte tutorial:

   "HTML doesn't have a way of expressing logic, like conditionals and loops. Svelte does.
   To conditionally render some markup, we wrap it in an if block."
